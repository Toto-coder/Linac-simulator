# Linac-simulator

A simulation of electrons' motion along the vertical axis inside a linear accelerator (linac). To appreciate the simulation, either run it on your computer through the python script (to enjoy it, you will need to considerably zoom out your terminal window) or watch the two videos: however, their quality is not of the best kind.
